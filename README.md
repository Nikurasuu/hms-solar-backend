# hms-solar-backend

This is the backend for the HMS Solar project, a tool which allows owners of hoymiles HMS-Wifi inverters to monitor their solar production. It relies on the [hms-mqtt-publisher](https://github.com/DennisOSRM/hms-mqtt-publisher) to access the data from MQTT (big thanks to [Dennis Luxen](https://github.com/DennisOSRM)).

**Disclaimer: This project is not affiliated with Hoymiles. It is an independent project developed to provide tools for interacting with Hoymiles HMS-XXXXW-2T series micro-inverters featuring integrated WiFi DTU.
