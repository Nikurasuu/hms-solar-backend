# hms-solar-backend

This is the backend for the HMS Solar project, a tool which allows owners of hoymiles HMS-Wifi inverters to monitor their solar production. It relies on the [hms-mqtt-publisher](https://github.com/DennisOSRM/hms-mqtt-publisher) to access the data from MQTT (big thanks to [Dennis Luxen](https://github.com/DennisOSRM)).
